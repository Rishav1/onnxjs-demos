Collection of fun browser applications using ONNXjs runtime

# Primers
- [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) stands for Open Neural Network Exchange. It is an intermediate representation for Neural Networks that is supported by frameworks like pytorch and tensorflow.
- [ONNXjs](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxjs) is a javascript library for running trained Neural Network models (exported in ONNX format)
- [ONNXjs-demo](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxjs-demo) is a github pages website that uses ONNXjs to run neural network models on browser.
- [PyTorch to ONNX](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html) shows how to export trained models in PyTorch to ONNX format.
- [Tensorflow to ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow) is an attempt by microsoft to support onnx format with tensorflow (funny becuase google owns TF).

# Ideas
- Running [Age progression](https://github.com/mattans/AgeProgression/tree/v1.1) model inference on browser using ONNXjs.
- Running Atari 2 player games against trained [DQN agent](https://github.com/Nasdin/ReinforcementLearning-AtariGame) on browser using ONNXjs.
- Deep Fakes on broswer using ONNXjs.
